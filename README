Just prototyping some network stuff. Ported to DPDK 21 by Luc/Wqrld

He be dragons: the code has not seen any kind of review (security or other).

requirements for compilation:

- openssl
- liburcu-dev
- libconfig-dev

- dpdk 21

The program compiles and links correctly, functioning is nog guaranteed in any way.

Running:

To run the program, you first need to edit the pipeline.conf and build the zones using the build_rules.py script in the etc folder. These are used for the firewall.

Then, to run the code normally:
build/firewall etc/pipeline.conf

or with debug mode:
build/firewall --log-level='.*,8' etc/pipeline.conf
