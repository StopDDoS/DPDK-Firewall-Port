Just prototyping some network stuff. Ported to DPDK 21 by Luc/Wqrld

He be dragons: the code has not seen any kind of review (security or other).

requirements for compilation:

- openssl
- liburcu-dev
- libconfig-dev

- dpdk 21

The program compiles and links correctly, functioning is nog guaranteed in any way.
